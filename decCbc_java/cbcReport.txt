Approach:
The encrypted text, of the form IV | C0 | C1 | ... where each block is 12 bytes long.
We where given the first value of the message, we knew the IV was at the beginning of the
encrypted message. With this information, we can recover the key:

M0 = 199305255870
C0 = IV
the first message m0 is known. Therefore the formula gives us:
(IV + M0) + K = C0 ->
K = C0 + (IV + M0)

When we recovered the key, we can then decrypt the message. We structured the block in a
way such that we can easily loop through them.

A message mi can be recovered by some simple math from the definition given from the lectures, such
that it looks like this:

mi = (k + ci) + c(i-1).

The key k is known, we have the ci and ci-1, and therefor we have everything to solve the value of each block.

We did not really know if we were supposed to include the personal nr, but we did. If we don't want it, we
just change the loop so it skips that block.
