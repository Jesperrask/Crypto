Approach:
We were given three intercepted cipher texts, with known modulus and public key.
The message were encrypted with the same public key, using different modulus. This
resulted in :

Z0 = C0 (mod0)
Z1 = C1 (mod1)
Z2 = C2 (mod2)

We can use the chinese remainder to solve the congurence.

-- Given x0 ≡ a1 mod n1
-- and   x1 ≡ a2 mod n2
--       x01 ≡ a  mod n1*n2

-- a = a1 * n2 * m2 + a2 * n1 *m1
-- m2 and m1 can be computed using EEA.
-- m1*n1 + m2*n2 = 1

when n1 and n2 are coprime.
Bézout's identity asserts the existence of two integers m1 and m2 such that
m1*n1 + m2*n2 = 1

We also know the public key (3). We can use the cube root function provided, to recover the message.
